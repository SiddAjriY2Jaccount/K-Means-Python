1) K-Means Clustering implementation from scratch using Python, attempting to form meaningful clusters from the College Dataset. Cluster Validity checked using Confusion Matrix, Entropy etc.

2) KNN implementation from scratch, also using Python, used for classification, results compared with SKLearn library functions.
